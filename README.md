 I will post the answer to the questions found in [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-examples/). Although this is more of a personal project so that I improve my own coding, 
you can use this repository if you got stuck on any question as you tried to solve them yourself and realized some of the answers on the site isn't very useful.

 My answers may not be as optimal as they could be but I am learning on the way at the time I am writing this so if you find anything to improve then let me know.
